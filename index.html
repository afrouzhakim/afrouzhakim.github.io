    <section class= "sec2">I design and code Front-End and I love it because it is the best way that I can mix both of my interest in Graphic Design and Coding. 
      I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

          I am a Front-End Developer with producing high quality responsive websites. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.
  I now specialize in Front-End development but my knowledge of multiple fields allows me to work on a project with the full scope in mind; simplifying the process of our working together and producing a more cohesive experience for your users.
  I can quickly and efficiently join your team using continuous-integration with methods and tools such as Git and Agile(Scrum).
  In some projects, my client’s require the ability to manage the content of their website. WordPress is the world’s most popular content management system which I have many 4 years of experience with.
